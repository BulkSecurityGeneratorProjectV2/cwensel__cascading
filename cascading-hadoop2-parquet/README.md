# Apache Parquet Support

The Apache Parquet project deprecated and removed Cascading support. 

This package, `cascading-hadoop2-parquet` and `cascading-hadoop2-parquet-thrift` are imports of the deprecated classes
into the Cascading project. 

We hope to retain and improve Cascading Parquet support over time.

The git command `filter-repo` was used to carve out the classes and retain the git commit history from the 
original project.
